# TrainScheduler

https://md0808.github.io/TrainScheduler/

### Usage
Users are able to view a table of incoming trains, their destination and information about their arrival. Through the input forms, users can also add a train and its associated information to the table.

### Technologies Used

The train scheduler application is written with javascript and jQuery to send input data to Firebase, which hosts arrival and departure data. Moment.js is incorporated to calculate next arrival time, minutes away from arrival, and to convert timestamps into legible dates.
